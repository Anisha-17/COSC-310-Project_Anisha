# COSC 310 Project: Office Security System

## Developed by:

# What is our project?

Our chosen project will be the analysis, design, implementation, and verification of a emulated office security system using a combination of processing and android studio using a to be determined local networking solution to allow for inter - app communication, providing both an emulated Scanner using android studio, to be used with physical NFC cards, aswell as a visual representation of the office building in processing to represent which doors are opened by the android studio app.

# How will this software system work?

We will be using a combination of NFC cards, as well as client sided software system to emulate a office building implementing our security system. There will be an emulated NFC scanner created using android studio, an emulated office building floor p-lan using processing, and inter - app communication implemented to allow for user input on the android studio appplication to be visually reflected in the processing application.

# How to compile and run the code

The project_demo was made using Processing 4.0.1. It should also run with earlier versions. The program will be updated when new versions of Processing are released if necessary

To implement the NFCScanner, download the latest version of android studio, clone the current main branch repository, and open the NFCScanner application using android studio. NOTE: As NFC scanning capabilities are essential to the NFCScanner app, the android studio app is required to be run on a physical device with an NFC scanner enabled. Failure to do so will result in the app immediately closing.
