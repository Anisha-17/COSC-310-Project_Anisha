Based on initial discussion, our team agreed the Waterfall Model was the best software development life cycle for our security system based on the idea that the system we are designing needs to be fully designed and implemented. This is a safety-critical system that required a log of up-front analysis before implementation. We need a structured, plan-driven approuch to our development. The customer has clear specification and overall requirements on the project which will not change through development. Therefore, it is safe to define requirements clearly before starting design and development.
